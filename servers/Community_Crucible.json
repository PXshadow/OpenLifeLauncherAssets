    "desc":"Community Crucible Mod (or CCM) is a modded server for One Hour One Life. We are adding new features as requested by the community. If you wish to get involved with the project either by making suggestions, reporting bugs or even working on new content be sure to join our discord server ((maybe place the discord server invite link in here). Griefing is not tolorated in our server and repeated offenders will be banned. To be able to moderate the server you will need to have an account key for the base One Hour One Life game however we are working on implementing a way to buy account keys just for the CCM for much cheaper than the base OHOL game",
